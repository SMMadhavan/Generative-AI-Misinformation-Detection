# AI-Driven Generative-AI Misinformation Detection & Trend Analytics

## Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting AI-generated misinformation using machine learning and natural language processing techniques. 
It also analyzes temporal and source-based trends to understand how generative-AI-driven misinformation evolves over time.

The system aims to assist digital platforms and fact-checkers by providing risk scores, feature explanations, and analytical insights.

## Key Objectives
- Detect AI-generated misinformation using NLP and ML models
- Analyze textual and metadata features contributing to misinformation
- Visualize misinformation trends across time, sources, and content types
- Provide explainable predictions through dashboards and APIs

## Project Status
