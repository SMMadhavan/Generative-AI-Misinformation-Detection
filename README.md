##  Project Overview
**Neural Auditor** is an enterprise-grade forensic tool designed to detect AI-generated misinformation and synthetic text patterns. By leveraging advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) and a hybrid machine learning pipeline, the system analyzes "Linguistic DNA"—features like burstiness, perplexity, and semantic richness—to distinguish between human-written journalism and machine-generated hallucinations.

Unlike simple classifiers, this project provides a **Forensic Dashboard** that offers real-time visualization, domain-specific sensitivity tuning (Politics, Healthcare, etc.), and automated PDF reporting for content moderation teams.

##  Key Features

###  **Forensic AI Analysis**
* **Hybrid Detection Engine:** Combines TF-IDF vectorization with "Linguistic DNA" features (sentence complexity, buzzword density) to detect robotic writing patterns.
* **Domain Context Awareness:** Adjusts sensitivity thresholds dynamically based on the topic (e.g., stricter rules for *Healthcare* vs. *Entertainment*).

###  **Interactive Dashboard**
* **Real-Time Visualization:** Radar charts displaying linguistic signatures (Uniformity vs. Richness).
* **Live Threat Logs:** SQLite-backed audit trail of all scanned content.
* **Visual Indicators:** Clear "Green/Yellow/Red" verdict system for Verified Human, Suspicious, or AI-Generated content.

###  **Automated Reporting**
* **PDF Generation:** One-click generation of professional forensic reports containing the analyzed text, verdict metadata, and confidence scores.

##  Development Milestones

### **Phase 1: Data Engineering**
* Successfully merged and cleaned a massive dataset of **117,493 rows** from ISOT, WELFake, and GenAI sources.
* Achieved a perfect **50/50 class balance** (~60k real vs. ~60k fake articles) to prevent model bias.

### **Phase 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
* Analyzed high-frequency terms using Word Clouds to identify "hallucination triggers."
* Visualized class distribution to ensure data integrity.

### **Phase 3: Modeling & Optimization**
* **Baseline:** Established initial accuracy of **51.3%** using memory-stable sampling.
* **Current Production Model:** Migrated to a **Calibrated LinearSVC Ensemble** with custom feature engineering, significantly improving detection rates on complex synthetic text.
